Problem 1:
Given a sentence, count how many words in the sentence have more than three characters. You can consider a word to be a
sequence of characters separated by spaces.
Problem 2:
Using Java's built-in date/time libraries, generate a list of all Mondays in the upcoming year. Print out each Monday's
date.
Problem 3:
Given a list of random numbers, use Java streams to find the smallest and largest numbers in the list. Do not use the
traditional loop-based method for this.
Problem 4:
Given a List of strings, find which strings have duplicates and how many duplicates each string has. Store this
information in a HashMap where the key is the string and the value is the count of occurrences. Print the resulting map.
Problem 5:
Given a sentence, reverse the order of the words in the sentence, but not the order of the letters in each word. For
instance, "Java is fun" should become "fun is Java".
Problem 6:
Design a system where an Employee class has fields for name, position, and salary. Create methods to give a raise,
deduct taxes, and print an employee's yearly earnings.
Problem 7
Design a generic class Pair<T, U> that can hold two items of potentially different types. Implement methods to retrieve each item.
