4. An abstract class has a constructor which prints "This is constructor of abstract class", an abstract method named '
   a_method' and a non-abstract method which prints "This is a normal method of abstract class". A class 'SubClass'
   inherits the abstract class and has a method named 'a_method' which prints "This is abstract method". Now create an
   object of 'SubClass' and call the abstract method and the non-abstract method. (Analyse the result)

5. Create an abstract class 'Animals' with two abstract methods 'cats' and 'dogs'. Now create a class 'Cats' with a
   method 'cats' which prints "Cats meow" and a class 'Dogs' with a method 'dogs' which prints "Dogs bark", both
   inheriting the class 'Animals'. Now create an object for each of the subclasses and call their respective methods.

6. We have to calculate the area of a rectangle, a square and a circle. Create an abstract class 'Shape' with three
   abstract methods namely 'RectangleArea' taking two parameters, 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' taking one parameter
   each. The parameters of 'RectangleArea' are its length and breadth, that of 'SquareArea' is its side and that of '
   CircleArea' is its radius. Now create another class 'Area' containing all the three methods 'RectangleArea', '
   SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' for printing the area of rectangle, square and circle respectively. Create an object of
   class 'Area' and call all the three methods.
